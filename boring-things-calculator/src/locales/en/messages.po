msgstr "At the top of the calculator you will find a sum to calculate. <0/>Begin by entering the first number. You do this by clicking on the dials under the colourful zeros. The colourful fields represent ones, tens, hundreds etc from right to left respectively. Therefore, it is important to work from right to left. <1/>If the sum is 23+45 you would enter the 3 first by clicking on the outer right dial three times. Then enter the 2 by moving one dial to the left and clicking twice. <2/>Now you are ready to enter the second number. There is no need to add a plus operator (+). The machine does this automatically.<3/>Now you can follow the same steps as before. Make sure to count how many times you click! The calculator simultaneously adds each click to the sum.<4/> The final result is shown in the coloured fields. Click <5>Submit</5> to enter your result.<6/>Have fun!"
